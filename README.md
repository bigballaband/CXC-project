# CxC Federato dashboard

Inspiration 📊
Every user action tells a story. On platforms like Federato RiskOps, underwriters rely on digital tools to assess risks and make decisions. But what if we could predict what they’ll do next? By understanding user behavior, we can optimize workflows, reduce drop-offs, and improve engagement.

That’s where FlowCast comes in. We built a Markov Chain model to analyze user interactions and uncover patterns in engagement. Our interactive dashboard helps visualize these insights, giving Federato the tools to enhance user retention and navigation.

What It Does 🔍
FlowCast analyzes user behavior and predicts the next most likely action based on historical interactions. Our model achieves 54% accuracy, demonstrating that user actions follow predictable patterns. By mapping these behaviors, we can:
✅ Identify common user journeys
✅ Predict next actions in real time
✅ Highlight areas where users drop off

With these insights, Federato can improve platform usability and keep users engaged for longer.

How We Built It 🚀
We processed user event data from Amplitude (2024-2025), built a Markov Chain transition model, and developed an interactive Streamlit dashboard to explore trends.
